Transport calculation for bulk Cu [001] with spin-orbit coupling.
Pay attention to Cu with artificial band splitting in the leads.
(Compare Cu_B and Cu_Bm files).

To run test you need to execute "test.seq" for 
sequential version of the code (very long calculation)
Or use include job-script (for Huygens) which will 
run "test.par" script.
