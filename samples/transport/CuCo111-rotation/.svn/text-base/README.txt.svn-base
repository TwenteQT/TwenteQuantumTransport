Example of calculation for Cu/Co [111] interface and non-collinearity.
rotations of magnetization for atoms are defined in file rot_mask.

To run test you need to execute "test.seq" for 
sequential version of the code (very long calculation)
Or use include job-script (for Huygens) which will 
run "test.par" script.
