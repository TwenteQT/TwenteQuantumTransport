Example of calculation of bulk AMR effect for Co [001].
This calculation is based on spin-orbit coupling.
To run test you need to execute "test.seq" for 
sequential version of the code (very long calculation)
Or use include job-script (for Huygens) which will 
run "test.par" script.

As result of calculation you will get 3 "andout" files.
andout.z - result or case when magnetic field parallel 
to transport direction (z-axis).
andout.x and andout.y - results for magnetic field orthogonal 
to the transport axis and parallel either to the X or Y axis.
results in both files should be equival!
